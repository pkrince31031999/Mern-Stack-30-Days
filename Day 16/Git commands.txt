WorkFlow :

    |
   add
    |
  commit
    | 
   push



Git Branches :

>> git branch ( to check branch )

>> git branch -M main ( to rename branch )

>> git checkout <branch name> ( to navigate )

>> git checkout -b <new branch name> ( to create new branch )

>> git branch -d <branch name> ( to delete branch )



Merging branches :

>> fit diff <branch name> ( to compare commits,branches,files&more )

>> git merge <branch name>



Pull command :

>> git pull origin main

Fixing Mistakes :


case 1 :  staged changes :

>> git reset <file name>

>> git reset


case 2 : commited changes (for one commit) :

>> git reset HEAD~1


case 3 : commited changes (for many commits) :

>> git reset <commit hash>

>> git reset --hard <commit hash>
